I fetched the api for movies and genre

## October 31st
Created the genre filter as well as the search bar for movies


## November 1st
Filter added for home page as well as including the search bar 

## November 3rd
Fixed Nav bar design 

## November 5th
Fixed minor bug where filter wasnt rendering based on genres and needed to correct the api endpoint for genres so it would filter correctly.

## November 6th 
Merging different branches onto main and fixed any conflicts that was present. Made adjustments where only the movie list renders when filter and search bar was used to improve performance.

## November 7th 
Added hooks on the liked page and blocked page so that genre and release date would appear on movies when user hovers.
